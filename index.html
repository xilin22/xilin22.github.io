		<h1>Projects!</h1>

		<h1>Scratch</h1>
		<h2>Brick Breaker in Scratch</h2>
		<p>I used the visual coind software to build games. Brick breaker was one of the projects included in the scratch unit. the goal of the game is to break the bricks on the screen; there could be a score board on the to make the game more interesting.</p>
		
		<h1>Python</h1>
		<h2>Text Adventure</h2>
		<p>For this program, the goal was to create an online version of the MadLibs. The program allows users to enter any word the matches the requirements set out in the begin of the game. After the user finishes entering all the words, the program would print out the text with the words the user input in it. To complete this game, I used the inpute functond in python as well as a use of multiple variable to get the words to print in the correct order.</p>
		
		<h2>Bouncing Ball in PyGame</h2>
		<p>The object of this game is to have a ball that moves around the pygame screen and have the screen change color every time the ball hits the edges of bthe screen. There is also the strecch challenge of making the ball change color when it hits the sides. To do this, I used pygame methods to create the shapes and move the object. The most challenging part of this project was to calculate the position of the ball, which is needed to set condtion for the ball and screen to change color.</p>

		<h2>Password Hashing</h2>
		<p>For this activity, my partner and I use rainbow hashes to store the incrypted user passwords and created a back end login in code that alerts the user when she/he inputs a wrong password. This sets up the situation to have us "hack" into a 3 letter encrypted passwarod. The feeling of accomplishment in this project was ... just...awesome? XD</p>

		<h1>C++ with robotics</h1>
		<h2>Robotics</h2>
		<p>C++ was used to control the arduino robots that my team mates and I build for this section. With C++, I made the light on top of the bread boad blink. My robot also dances and navigate through paths using its sensors. My take-away from this is that C++ is very particular with syntax.</p>
